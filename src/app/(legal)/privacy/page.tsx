            In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled

            work or at the place where the alleged violation occurred. The right
            to log a complaint is in effect regardless of any other
            administrative or court proceedings available as legal recourses.

              In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data

              claim. During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you
              have the right to demand that we restrict the processing of your

              If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to
